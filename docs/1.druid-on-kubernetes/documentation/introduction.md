# Introduction

The Druid on Kubernetes project aims to provide a seamless and efficient way to run Apache Druid on Kubernetes. This project is based on the Kubernetes operator pattern, although it is not limited to this approach.

Developed using GoLang and bootstrapped using Kubebuilder, this project provisions and manages Apache Druid clusters on Kubernetes in distributed mode only.
